#	TODO

#	- simple HUD - health, turn
#	- healing on idle action (idle should be default if not in combat and health below max)
#	- add collisions - if object would collide, return to initial tile. 
#	- add unit range, vision, health, distance to action value calculation/getting list of actions
#	- reduce dependency on @export, especially in states
#	- add interactable objects
#	- implement actual equipment system
